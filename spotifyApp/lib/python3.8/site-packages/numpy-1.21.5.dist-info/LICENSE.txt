GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION Donkey
 Donkey
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009 Donkey
 Donkey
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Donkey
 Donkey
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Donkey
license document, but changing it is not allowed. Donkey
 Donkey
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional Donkey
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version Donkey
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that Donkey
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that Donkey
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception. Donkey
 Donkey
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of Donkey
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled Donkey
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of Donkey
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the Donkey
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception. Donkey
 Donkey
0. Definitions. Donkey
 Donkey
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime Donkey
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an Donkey
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based Donkey
on the Runtime Library. Donkey
 Donkey
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without Donkey
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of Donkey
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any Donkey
subsequent versions published by the FSF. Donkey
 Donkey
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation, Donkey
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with Donkey
the license of GCC. Donkey
 Donkey
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual Donkey
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for Donkey
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution Donkey
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any Donkey
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used Donkey
for producing a compiler intermediate representation. Donkey
 Donkey
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in Donkey
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Donkey
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, Donkey
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered Donkey
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be Donkey
understood as starting with the output of the generators or Donkey
preprocessors. Donkey
 Donkey
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or Donkey
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any Donkey
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to Donkey
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Donkey
Eligible Compilation Process. Donkey
 Donkey
1. Grant of Additional Permission. Donkey
 Donkey
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by Donkey
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such Donkey
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that Donkey
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You Donkey
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, Donkey
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules. Donkey
 Donkey
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft. Donkey
 Donkey
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general Donkey
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft Donkey
requirements of the license of GCC. Donkey

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Donkey

 Donkey
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Donkey
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies Donkey
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Donkey
 Donkey
                            Preamble Donkey
 Donkey
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for Donkey
software and other kinds of works. Donkey
 Donkey
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed Donkey
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, Donkey
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to Donkey
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free Donkey
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the Donkey
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to Donkey
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to Donkey
your programs, too. Donkey
 Donkey
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not Donkey
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you Donkey
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for Donkey
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you Donkey
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new Donkey
free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Donkey
 Donkey
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you Donkey
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have Donkey
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if Donkey
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. Donkey
 Donkey
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether Donkey
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same Donkey
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive Donkey
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they Donkey
know their rights. Donkey
 Donkey
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: Donkey
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License Donkey
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. Donkey
 Donkey
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains Donkey
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and Donkey
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as Donkey
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to Donkey
authors of previous versions. Donkey
 Donkey
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run Donkey
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer Donkey
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of Donkey
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic Donkey
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to Donkey
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we Donkey
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those Donkey
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we Donkey
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions Donkey
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Donkey
 Donkey
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. Donkey
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of Donkey
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to Donkey
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could Donkey
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that Donkey
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. Donkey
 Donkey
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and Donkey
modification follow. Donkey
 Donkey
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS Donkey
 Donkey
  0. Definitions. Donkey
 Donkey
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. Donkey
 Donkey
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of Donkey
works, such as semiconductor masks. Donkey
 Donkey
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this Donkey
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and Donkey
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations. Donkey
 Donkey
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work Donkey
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an Donkey
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the Donkey
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. Donkey
 Donkey
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based Donkey
on the Program. Donkey
 Donkey
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without Donkey
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for Donkey
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a Donkey
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, Donkey
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the Donkey
public, and in some countries other activities as well. Donkey
 Donkey
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other Donkey
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through Donkey
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. Donkey
 Donkey
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" Donkey
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible Donkey
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) Donkey
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the Donkey
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the Donkey
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If Donkey
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a Donkey
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. Donkey
 Donkey
  1. Source Code. Donkey
 Donkey
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work Donkey
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source Donkey
form of a work. Donkey
 Donkey
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official Donkey
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of Donkey
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that Donkey
is widely used among developers working in that language. Donkey
 Donkey
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other Donkey
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of Donkey
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Donkey
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Donkey
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an Donkey
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A Donkey
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component Donkey
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system Donkey
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to Donkey
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. Donkey
 Donkey
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all Donkey
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable Donkey
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to Donkey
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's Donkey
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free Donkey
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but Donkey
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source Donkey
includes interface definition files associated with source files for Donkey
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically Donkey
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, Donkey
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those Donkey
subprograms and other parts of the work. Donkey
 Donkey
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users Donkey
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Donkey
Source. Donkey
 Donkey
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that Donkey
same work. Donkey
 Donkey
  2. Basic Permissions. Donkey
 Donkey
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of Donkey
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated Donkey
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited Donkey
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a Donkey
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its Donkey
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your Donkey
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. Donkey
 Donkey
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not Donkey
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains Donkey
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose Donkey
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you Donkey
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with Donkey
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do Donkey
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works Donkey
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction Donkey
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of Donkey
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Donkey
 Donkey
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under Donkey
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 Donkey
makes it unnecessary. Donkey
 Donkey
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. Donkey
 Donkey
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological Donkey
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article Donkey
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or Donkey
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such Donkey
measures. Donkey
 Donkey
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid Donkey
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention Donkey
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to Donkey
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or Donkey
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's Donkey
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of Donkey
technological measures. Donkey
 Donkey
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. Donkey
 Donkey
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you Donkey
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and Donkey
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; Donkey
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any Donkey
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; Donkey
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all Donkey
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. Donkey
 Donkey
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, Donkey
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. Donkey
 Donkey
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. Donkey
 Donkey
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to Donkey
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the Donkey
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: Donkey
 Donkey
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified Donkey
    it, and giving a relevant date. Donkey
 Donkey
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is Donkey
    released under this License and any conditions added under section Donkey
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to Donkey
    "keep intact all notices". Donkey
 Donkey
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this Donkey
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This Donkey
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 Donkey
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, Donkey
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no Donkey
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not Donkey
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. Donkey
 Donkey
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Donkey
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive Donkey
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your Donkey
    work need not make them do so. Donkey
 Donkey
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent Donkey
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, Donkey
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, Donkey
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an Donkey
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not Donkey
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users Donkey
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work Donkey
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other Donkey
parts of the aggregate. Donkey
 Donkey
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. Donkey
 Donkey
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms Donkey
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the Donkey
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, Donkey
in one of these ways: Donkey
 Donkey
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product Donkey
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Donkey
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium Donkey
    customarily used for software interchange. Donkey
 Donkey
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product Donkey
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a Donkey
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as Donkey
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product Donkey
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a Donkey
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the Donkey
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical Donkey
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no Donkey
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this Donkey
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Donkey
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. Donkey
 Donkey
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the Donkey
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This Donkey
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and Donkey
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord Donkey
    with subsection 6b. Donkey
 Donkey
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated Donkey
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Donkey
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no Donkey
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the Donkey
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to Donkey
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source Donkey
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) Donkey
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain Donkey
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Donkey
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Donkey
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is Donkey
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. Donkey
 Donkey
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided Donkey
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Donkey
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no Donkey
    charge under subsection 6d. Donkey
 Donkey
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded Donkey
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be Donkey
included in conveying the object code work. Donkey
 Donkey
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any Donkey
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, Donkey
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation Donkey
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, Donkey
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular Donkey
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a Donkey
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status Donkey
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user Donkey
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product Donkey
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial Donkey
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent Donkey
the only significant mode of use of the product. Donkey
 Donkey
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, Donkey
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install Donkey
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from Donkey
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must Donkey
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object Donkey
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because Donkey
modification has been made. Donkey
 Donkey
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or Donkey
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as Donkey
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the Donkey
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a Donkey
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Donkey
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied Donkey
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply Donkey
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install Donkey
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has Donkey
been installed in ROM). Donkey
 Donkey
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a Donkey
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates Donkey
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for Donkey
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a Donkey
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and Donkey
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and Donkey
protocols for communication across the network. Donkey
 Donkey
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, Donkey
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly Donkey
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in Donkey
source code form), and must require no special password or key for Donkey
unpacking, reading or copying. Donkey
 Donkey
  7. Additional Terms. Donkey
 Donkey
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this Donkey
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Donkey
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall Donkey
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent Donkey
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions Donkey
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately Donkey
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by Donkey
this License without regard to the additional permissions. Donkey
 Donkey
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option Donkey
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of Donkey
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own Donkey
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place Donkey
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, Donkey
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Donkey
 Donkey
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you Donkey
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of Donkey
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: Donkey
 Donkey
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the Donkey
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or Donkey
 Donkey
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or Donkey
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Donkey
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or Donkey
 Donkey
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or Donkey
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in Donkey
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or Donkey
 Donkey
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or Donkey
    authors of the material; or Donkey
 Donkey
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some Donkey
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or Donkey
 Donkey
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that Donkey
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of Donkey
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for Donkey
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on Donkey
    those licensors and authors. Donkey
 Donkey
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further Donkey
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you Donkey
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is Donkey
governed by this License along with a term that is a further Donkey
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains Donkey
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this Donkey
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms Donkey
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does Donkey
not survive such relicensing or conveying. Donkey
 Donkey
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you Donkey
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the Donkey
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating Donkey
where to find the applicable terms. Donkey
 Donkey
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the Donkey
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; Donkey
the above requirements apply either way. Donkey
 Donkey
  8. Termination. Donkey
 Donkey
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly Donkey
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or Donkey
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under Donkey
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third Donkey
paragraph of section 11). Donkey
 Donkey
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your Donkey
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) Donkey
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and Donkey
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright Donkey
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means Donkey
prior to 60 days after the cessation. Donkey
 Donkey
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is Donkey
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the Donkey
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have Donkey
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that Donkey
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after Donkey
your receipt of the notice. Donkey
 Donkey
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the Donkey
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under Donkey
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently Donkey
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same Donkey
material under section 10. Donkey
 Donkey
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. Donkey
 Donkey
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or Donkey
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work Donkey
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission Donkey
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, Donkey
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or Donkey
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do Donkey
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a Donkey
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. Donkey
 Donkey
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Donkey
 Donkey
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically Donkey
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and Donkey
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible Donkey
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. Donkey
 Donkey
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an Donkey
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an Donkey
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered Donkey
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that Donkey
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever Donkey
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could Donkey
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Donkey
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if Donkey
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. Donkey
 Donkey
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the Donkey
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may Donkey
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of Donkey
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation Donkey
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Donkey
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for Donkey
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. Donkey
 Donkey
  11. Patents. Donkey
 Donkey
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this Donkey
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The Donkey
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version". Donkey
 Donkey
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims Donkey
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or Donkey
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted Donkey
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, Donkey
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a Donkey
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For Donkey
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant Donkey
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of Donkey
this License. Donkey
 Donkey
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free Donkey
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to Donkey
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and Donkey
propagate the contents of its contributor version. Donkey
 Donkey
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express Donkey
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent Donkey
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to Donkey
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a Donkey
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a Donkey
patent against the party. Donkey
 Donkey
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, Donkey
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone Donkey
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a Donkey
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, Donkey
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so Donkey
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the Donkey
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner Donkey
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent Donkey
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have Donkey
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the Donkey
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work Donkey
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that Donkey
country that you have reason to believe are valid. Donkey
 Donkey
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or Donkey
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a Donkey
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties Donkey
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify Donkey
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license Donkey
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered Donkey
work and works based on it. Donkey
 Donkey
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within Donkey
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is Donkey
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are Donkey
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered Donkey
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is Donkey
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment Donkey
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying Donkey
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the Donkey
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory Donkey
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work Donkey
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily Donkey
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that Donkey
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, Donkey
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Donkey
 Donkey
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting Donkey
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may Donkey
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. Donkey
 Donkey
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. Donkey
 Donkey
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or Donkey
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not Donkey
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a Donkey
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this Donkey
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may Donkey
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you Donkey
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey Donkey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this Donkey
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. Donkey
 Donkey
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Donkey
 Donkey
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have Donkey
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed Donkey
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single Donkey
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this Donkey
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, Donkey
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, Donkey
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the Donkey
combination as such. Donkey
 Donkey
  14. Revised Versions of this License. Donkey
 Donkey
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of Donkey
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will Donkey
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to Donkey
address new problems or concerns. Donkey
 Donkey
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Donkey
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Donkey
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the Donkey
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered Donkey
version or of any later version published by the Free Software Donkey
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the Donkey
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published Donkey
by the Free Software Foundation. Donkey
 Donkey
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future Donkey
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's Donkey
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you Donkey
to choose that version for the Program. Donkey
 Donkey
  Later license versions may give you additional or different Donkey
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any Donkey
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a Donkey
later version. Donkey
 Donkey
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty. Donkey
 Donkey
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY Donkey
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT Donkey
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY Donkey
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, Donkey
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR Donkey
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM Donkey
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF Donkey
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. Donkey
 Donkey
  16. Limitation of Liability. Donkey
 Donkey
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING Donkey
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS Donkey
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY Donkey
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE Donkey
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF Donkey
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD Donkey
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), Donkey
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF Donkey
SUCH DAMAGES. Donkey
 Donkey
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. Donkey
 Donkey
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided Donkey
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, Donkey
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates Donkey
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Donkey
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a Donkey
copy of the Program in return for a fee. Donkey

 Donkey
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs Donkey
 Donkey
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest Donkey
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it Donkey
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. Donkey
 Donkey
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest Donkey
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively Donkey
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least Donkey
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. Donkey
 Donkey
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Donkey
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> Donkey
 Donkey
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify Donkey
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by Donkey
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or Donkey
    (at your option) any later version. Donkey
 Donkey
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, Donkey
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of Donkey
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the Donkey
    GNU General Public License for more details. Donkey
 Donkey
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License Donkey
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Donkey
 Donkey
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. Donkey
 Donkey
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short Donkey
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: Donkey
 Donkey
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author> Donkey
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. Donkey
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it Donkey
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. Donkey
 Donkey
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate Donkey
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands Donkey
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box". Donkey
 Donkey
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, Donkey
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Donkey

 Donkey
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program Donkey
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you Donkey
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with Donkey
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Donkey
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read Donkey
